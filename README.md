# Condotierre
I'm currently working on a java project where I want to set-up my own rpg/strategy game.
As a aspiring programmer, who just started some 8 months ago, I wanted to make my own game.
When I was a teenager I liked those 4x, strategy with some kind of rpg element mixed in. 
Now, once I started learning Java, I wanted to see how far I can go in making my childhood memories a reality!

## About
The title already hints what I'm trying to do. 
Condotierre, for those who don't know, is an italian mercenary during the times of the renaissance.
Mercenaries seeking employment from town to town in nothern Italy.
Reason why they were so popular there, is because those cities where fighting each other to gain the upperhand.
So soldiers willing to fight for a decent coin would find city contracts very lucrative. 
Machiavelli even wrote in his famous work The Prince about those mercenaries as an unreliable military force.
